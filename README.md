## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> Data source:For this analysis, we will use a dataset simulating hypothetical medical expenses for a set of patients spread across 4 US regions. This dataset has 1338 observations and 7 variables.

The main objetive here is trying to predicti Hospital Expenses with Machine Learning in R.

## Solution Strategy
For that, I used RStudio.
* Step 01: Collecting Data;
* Step 02: Exploring and Preparing the Data;
* Step 03: Training the model (using the training data);
* Step 04: Evaluating the Model's Performance;
* Step 05: Optimizing model performance.


## Next Steps
* Improve the parameters.
* Understand the correlation between variables.

## Disclaimer 
A good part of this project was largely done in the Data Science Academy, Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning course (part of the Data Scientist training)
